      <h1> Design Choices </h1>
      <li>
        <b>Map</b>
        The colors for the provinces is green because this is a clear color, and because the variables are money-related.
        I added extra thick border between provinces and they become even thicker when the user hovers over it. The reason behind this is that it adds more contrast between the coloring between different provinces
        Adding the click function makes the website interactive and allows the user to spit through the data. The barchart changes when a province is clicked on and results are smoothly shown with transition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Chart</b>
        The colors of the chart were chosen because I thought they fitted nicely with the colors of the map.
        I chose to also make a legend for the variables in the barchart, because the names are very long. This way the user knows better where he or she is looking at.
        Province name appears in chart when a province is clicked on in the map for better readability of the chart.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Tipbox</b>
        Yellow was an unused color so it is perfect for the readability in the tipbox.
      </li>
      <li>
      <b>Links</b>
        Color blue is used for clickable options on the webpage(s), because people relate this color to links.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Font</b>
        Avenir is used because it is a not very common font but it is looks very nice. I got the inspiration to use it because of the logo from iAmsterdam, which uses this font.  </p>
