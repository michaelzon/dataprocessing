    <h1> Storytelling </h1>
    <p>The visualization shows comparable data on income inequality in The Netherlands and variables that (may) have an effect on this.
       These well-being variables are portrayed in the barchart. The variables on income are portrayed with color and shown in the tipbox on the map
      of The Netherlands. The visualization gives the reader clarity about how differences in income may be caused with for example, access to services that is measured with the share of households with an internet broadband access. Adding the variable perceived social support was caused by the curiosity of the author who thought that this maybe could have a relation with income inequality. Showing interaction when the reader clicks on a region is the main key of the story when it comes down to inequality in The Netherlands. Looking at the graph, the inequality is minimal. The goal was to make the user explorate differences in income between regions in the Netherlands and its causes.
